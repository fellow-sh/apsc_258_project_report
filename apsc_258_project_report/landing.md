# APSC 258 Design Project Report

This project explores the development of a compact neural network capable of real-time steering prediction for the Raspberry Pi-based SunFounder PiCar-V. The network applies concepts of deep learning and convolution neural networks learned from APSC 258, as well as drawing inspiration from real-world computer vision models, like VGG-16 and Xception.

The project involves balancing our model's computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, ensuring the PiCar can both operate on the limited hardware resources of the Raspberry Pi. This report outlines the methodology, implementation, and evaluation of the proposed solution, highlighting its potential applications in autonomous vehicle systems.
