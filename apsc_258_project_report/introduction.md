# Introduction

This project explores the design of a neural network for the purpose of enabling autonomous line-following on the SunFounder PiCar-V. The pursuit of this project is motivated by the increased public appearance of self-driving cars and the prominence of AI in recent times. In the context of autonomous road vehicles, deep learning has the capacity to compute appropriate steering angles for a diverse set of environments where hard-coded control systems may be less robust. Our team tackled the challenge of developing a model that is not only accurate and stable in its steering predictions, but also fast enough to run in real time with limited laptop CPU time. This report documents the process of collecting training data, experimenting with various network architectures, and ultimately optimizing the model for efficient, responsive control with the PiCar.

Over the past decade, the rise of artificial intelligence has transformed a wide range of industries, with autonomous vehicles being one of the most impacted areas. Companies like Tesla, Waymo, and NVIDIA have invested heavily in the development of self-driving systems that rely on computer vision and machine learning to interpret the road and make real-time driving decisions. At the heart of these systems are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have proven highly effective at extracting features from images and enabling object detection and classification. This surge in AI-driven autonomy highlights the growing need for engineers who can design models that are both intelligent and efficient in real-world constraints.

The development of these deep learning systems blends both experimentation and engineering. While neural network design is guided by activation functions, optimization, and gradient flow, much of the architectural fine-tuning relies on testing. Iterating through different layer configurations and filter sizes involves a significant amount trial and error, evaluated through performance metrics rather than theory. At the same time, implementing these models in existing systems requires system engineering, including runtime optimization and real-time responsiveness. This dual nature makes deep learning a uniquely multi-disciplinary field that draws from computer science, control theory, and application-specific design. It is also because of such duality that this project offers an excellent opportunity to practice experimental and iterative design processes through the application of classroom teachings, external research, and internal testing.

## Objectives

To enable the PiCar to reliably follow a green line, we needed to design a neural network that could make accurate steering predictions in real time. This requirement introduced a unique set of design constraints: the model had to be precise enough to handle a variety of track shapes, stable enough to prevent erratic behavior, and lightweight enough to run alongside other system processes without introducing latency. The following objectives were established to guide the model’s development and ensure reliable performance in a real-world setting:

First, the model must output adequate turn angles for all possible track turns (within 3-5 degrees all the time). The PiCar must navigate a track with potentially sharp or subtle turns. If the model outputs inaccurate turn angles, the car may veer off the track or fail to follow the green line. A precision of 3-5 degrees ensures the car can handle a wide range of track configurations while maintaining smooth movement.

Second, the model must retain consistent outputs to avoid turning jitter, i.e. not output turning angles of 93 and 87 immediately after when following a straight line. Jitter refers to rapid, erratic changes in the turning angle, which can cause the car to wobble or behave unpredictably. This is especially problematic on straight paths, where the car should maintain the same angle continuously. Consistent outputs ensure stability and smooth operation, improving the user experience and reducing wear on the car's components.

Finally, the model must by lightweight enough to run in real time, being able to work alongside video streaming and processing from the PiCar and continuous transmission of turning commands from a laptop. Most of the system processing is handled by a laptop where it must process video input, detect the green line, calculate turn angles, and transmit commands—all in real time. A lightweight model ensures that these tasks can run simultaneously without lag, enabling the car to respond quickly to changes in the track. This is critical for maintaining real-time performance and avoiding delays that could lead to errors in navigation. These objectives collectively aim to balance accuracy, stability, and efficiency, ensuring the PiCar can reliably follow the green line in a dynamic, real-world environment.
