# ENGR 258 Project Report

A comprehensive report of my ENGR 258 group project.

## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop and/or build the ENGR 258 Project Report book, you should:

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
3. (Optional) Edit the books source files located in the `engr_258_project_report/` directory
4. Run `jupyter-book clean engr_258_project_report/` to remove any existing builds
5. Run `jupyter-book build engr_258_project_report/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `engr_258_project_report/_build/html/`.
